## Installation

In order to set up the project and keep a consistent environment across different operating systems and developer environments, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install requirements

Make sure you have installed the [requirements](./README.md#requirements).

### 2. Set up the virtual environment

In order to get consistent executions and results, a virtual environment must be used. You can set up a virtual environment with the following command.

#### Linux/MacOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```ps
python -m venv venv
venv\bin\Activate.ps1
```

_Note: To leave the virtual environment, run the command `deactivate`_

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
